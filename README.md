# About the project
The bootcamp hackathon theme was about films and each group was assigned a different movie Our group was assigned Mad Max. Inspired by the anarchic and hopeless nature of a post-apocalyptic setting where resources are scarce and violence reigns supreme, we came up with the idea of creating a web app allocated in the deep web, that provides different services to every other user in order to thrive in this world.
